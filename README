	matricies, create sets of points, and perform transformations on points.  It also defines a Surface 
	class that defines a full surface which consists of a set of points, lines which connect two points, 
	and planes which are sets of 3 or more points.

	inherite Matrix from array 
	remove reference to this.data in the Matrix class
	ensure the matrix manipulations work on other dimension matricies in a more generic fashion 
	add class to allow for shading of planes from a specific light source
